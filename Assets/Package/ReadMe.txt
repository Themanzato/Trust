Thank you for downloading my controller template.

Being a template you will likely want to adjust some of the settings to suit the requirements of your game.

You will need your own animations for this template, which you can set up by either applying the relevant animations to each state; found at "Animations/PlayerController" or by adding your own stop-frame animation to each relevant animation clip all contained within the animations folder. (Sorry I'm just a programmer :( ).

The controller is in an early development state and will very likely have several future updates to make it more customizable to match a range of preferences as well as added functionality to areas such as audio / sound effects.
